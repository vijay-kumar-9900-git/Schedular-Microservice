
Scaling Strategy for Job Scheduler Microservice
Objective: Enhance the scalability and reliability of the job scheduler microservice.

Horizontal Scaling:

Deploy multiple instances of the microservice using Docker and Kubernetes for load balancing and fault tolerance.
Scale the PostgreSQL database with read replicas to distribute query loads and improve performance.
API Management:

Implement an API gateway to handle routing, authentication, and load balancing.
Use caching solutions like Redis to reduce database load and speed up API responses.
